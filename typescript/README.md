# **TypeScript Notes**

This directory contains comprehensive and structured notes on TypeScript, covering everything from core basics to advanced concepts and interview-specific questions. The aim of these notes is to serve as a single, complete reference for revising TypeScript for development and technical interviews.

## **What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds type safety, modern tooling support, and compile-time error checking. TypeScript code compiles to JavaScript, allowing it to work in any environment where JavaScript runs.

---

## **Why Learn TypeScript?**

* Provides static type checking and catches errors at compile time.
* Improves code reliability and maintainability.
* Enhances developer productivity with better IntelliSense and tooling.
* Ideal for large-scale applications and industry-standard frameworks such as React, Angular, Node.js, and Next.js.
* Widely used across startups, product companies, and enterprise systems.
