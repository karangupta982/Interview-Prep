# Interview Prep

The **Interview Prep** repository is a structured, topic-wise collection of technical notes, explanations, and practical code examples designed to help students and developers prepare for software engineering interviews.
It serves as a comprehensive study source, covering both fundamental and advanced topics in technologies commonly used in modern development and interview discussions.

---

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to create a single, organized space for learning and revising important interview concepts. Each section is carefully curated to build a solid understanding of how technologies work at both conceptual and implementation levels.

Every topic folder contains:

* Well-explained theory with examples
* Frequently asked interview questions
* Code snippets and conceptual breakdowns
* Implementation-focused notes for clarity and revision

This repository evolves over time, expanding with more technologies, deeper concepts, and new sections related to system design, data structures, and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is designed for scalability. Each topic or technology has its own dedicated folder containing subtopics or modules.

```
Interview-Prep/
│
├── JavaScript/
│   ├── js-fundamentals/
│   └── js-advanced-concepts/
│
├── ReactJS/
│
├── NodeJS/
│
├── MongoDB/
│
└── Other-Topics/
```

Each folder can include the following:

* **README.md** – Overview and roadmap of the topic
* **Concept Files** – Notes, explanations, and example code
* **Interview Questions** – Frequently asked questions with clear solutions

---

## Purpose

The repository is built with the following objectives:

1. To provide a structured learning resource for interview preparation.
2. To simplify the process of revising key technical concepts before interviews.
3. To help developers strengthen their understanding of real-world technologies.
4. To maintain a growing and adaptable codebase that evolves with new tools and frameworks.
