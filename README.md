# Interview Prep

The **Interview Prep** repository is a structured, topic-wise collection of technical notes, explanations, and practical code examples designed to help students and developers prepare for software engineering interviews.
It serves as a comprehensive study source, covering both fundamental and advanced topics in technologies commonly used in modern development and interview discussions.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to create a single, organized space for learning and revising important interview concepts. Each section is carefully curated to build a solid understanding of how technologies work at both conceptual and implementation levels.

Every topic folder contains:

* Well-explained theory with examples
* Frequently asked interview questions
* Code snippets and conceptual breakdowns
* Implementation-focused notes for clarity and revision

This repository evolves over time, expanding with more technologies, deeper concepts, and new sections related to system design, data structures, and algorithms.
