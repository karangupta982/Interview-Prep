# What is a Hook in React?

A **Hook** is a special function in React that lets functional components use features like:

* **state**
* **lifecycle methods**
* **context**
* **performance optimizations**

Hooks allow you to do everything that class components used to do, but in a **cleaner and simpler** way.

### Example Hooks:

* `useState` → to manage state
* `useEffect` → to handle side effects
* `useContext` → to use context
* `useRef` → to store mutable values or access DOM
* `useMemo`, `useCallback` → optimization
* Custom hooks → reuse logic
