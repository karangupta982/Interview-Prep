# What is the Virtual DOM?

The **Virtual DOM (VDOM)** is a **lightweight JavaScript representation** of the actual DOM.

It is:

* a **copy** of the real DOM
* stored in memory
* cheap and fast to update
* used by React to calculate the most efficient way to update the real DOM

# Why Virtual DOM?

Because **updating the real DOM is slow**.
Updating a JavaScript object (Virtual DOM) is **super fast**.
